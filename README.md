## Experimentation with B-Splines

This code implements and visualises the B-splines basis functions. We implement these functions from scratch. This is a good exercise to check that I am understanding what's going on under the hood.

### Dependencies
- numpy 1.20.1
- Matplotlib 3.3.4

### Useful material
